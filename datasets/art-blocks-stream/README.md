## :speech_balloon: About

Art Blocks is a first of its kind platform focused on genuinely programmable on
demand generative content that is stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain.
You pick a style that you like, pay for the work, and a randomly generated
version of the content is created by an algorithm and sent to your Ethereum
account. The resulting piece might be a static image, 3D model, or an
interactive experience. Each output is different and there are endless
possibilities for the types of content that can be created on the platform.
